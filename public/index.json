In this post, I explore some good, bad, and greyscale color options, and briefly discuss the merits or faults of each. So, lets dive in!\nI know, I know, we’ve probably all seen enough coronavirus visualizations to last a lifetime, but here is one more! I was curious if the great toilet paper panic was a particularly American phenomenon, or if this was an anxiety that struck in the time of coronavirus regardless of nationality. To take a peek into this question, I used Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/) to gather data on search interest for coronavirus and toilet paper across three countries: China, Italy, and the United States, over the past 90 days. I figured this would make for an interesting color choice challenge, since we have three country variables, but each country has information on two different items, so we need to make a two-dimensional distinction.\n# Getting data.

This dataset ended up being really tricky to work with, but I think it was a good exercise in both how to use color to improve interpretation of a plot, but also how color can make a plot much more confusing (as will be demonstrated in the third plot). Although the plot is relatively simple, just six plotted lines, as mentioned above the relationships between the data/lines is a bit more complex than just six discrete/qualitative variables. Therefore, selecting six discrete colors would not make sense, as it would likely obfuscate the fact that each country had two sets of information/two lines, one for their interest/search frequency in/of coronavirus, and one for toilet paper. Connecting the two sets by country by means of color felt like a successful choice, because you can easily look at the two sets of lines and realize that the blue lines (indicating data belonging to the U.S.) show peaks occuring around the same time frame, which was the whole point of the plot. I opted to make the lines for the two different opacities, in order to still make it clear that they were indeed measuring two different things, despite being connected, although this felt like a secondary point, since I opted to create a subplot for the toilet paper data. I didn’t just choose that to offset the toilet paper data, however, I do think that the two different sets of dependent variables could have shared a common y-axis and been distinguished from each other using color, however, since the values for toilet paper interest were so much lower than for coronavirus, and the point was not to compare absolute values of one search term to the other (instead to see if they peaked at the same time), creating subplots in order to emphazise the peaks in the T.P. data made more sense to me. So, my overall take away from the visualization is that, yes, it does look like there was some coronavirus-related toilet paper panic in the United States, but not so much for China or Italy. Priorities!\nFull disclosure, I don’t love the colors used in the plot above. I think they’re starting to veer into ugly territory, a little too saturated for my tastes. But, this blue/yellow/magenta palette seems to work best for colorblind viewers. I’ll need to keep playing around to find a color palette that I like that still works well for those with colorblindness.\n Version with greyscale tp_plot_corona \u0026lt;- tp_data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(Day, coronavirus, color = Country)) + geom_line(linetype=\u0026quot;longdash\u0026quot;) + scale_color_manual(values = c(\u0026#39;#000000\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#808080\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#D3D3D3\u0026#39;)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Coronavirus\\nInterest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + labs(title = \u0026quot;\u0026#39;Coronavirus\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;Toilet Paper\u0026#39;\\nGoogle Search Interest Levels in Early 2020\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() tp_plot_tp \u0026lt;- tp_data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(Day, toilet_paper, color = Country)) + geom_line(alpha = 1) + scale_color_manual(values = c(\u0026#39;#000000\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#808080\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#D3D3D3\u0026#39;)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Toilet Paper\\nInterest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() tp_plot_full \u0026lt;- ggarrange(tp_plot_corona, tp_plot_tp, heights = c(2, 0.8), ncol = 1, nrow = 2, common.legend = TRUE, align = \u0026#39;v\u0026#39;, legend = \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;) tp_plot_full Hmm, I’m not as psyched about this one as I was the colored version. Since there are only three “hues” in the original, to distinguish the countries, it was pretty straightforward to translate those into greyscale in a way that ensures they are distinguishable (although I suppose the lightest value is a bit light, I think it is acceptable at least on a screen…I’d have to do some print tests to make sure it was ok in other mediums). Increasing the alpha for the T.P. subplot no longer worked well to set it off, since that made the greys less distinguishable…the increased overlap in the data also didn’t help. I still wanted an easy way for the eye to differentiate the lines in the top plot versus the bottom, and although, in my opinion, complexity in a plot works best when it increases top-to-bottom, making the lines in the bottom plot dashed was just as difficult to visually parse as when they were made more transparent…so I opted to make the top plot lines dashed. I think the greyscale setup works, but it’s not terribly groundbreaking or beautiful.\n Version with dreadful color tp_long \u0026lt;- tp_data %\u0026gt;%pivot_longer(c(coronavirus, toilet_paper), names_to = \u0026quot;searchterms\u0026quot;, values_to = \u0026quot;interest\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Country_SearchTerm = paste(Country, searchterms, sep = \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;), Country = NULL, searchterms = NULL) tp_plot_bad \u0026lt;- tp_long %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(Day, interest, color = Country_SearchTerm)) + geom_line() + scale_color_manual(values = c(\u0026#39;#800000\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#FF9999\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#000075\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#6666DB\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#469990\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#ACFFF6\u0026#39;)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Search Interest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + labs(title = \u0026quot;\u0026#39;Coronavirus\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;Toilet Paper\u0026#39;\\nGoogle Search Interest Levels in Early 2020\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() tp_plot_bad Above was my original attempt at this plot…I had good intentions – my goal was still wanted to link the data together by country, but I ended up separating the coronavirus data from the T.P. data by lightening the colors 40% (according to https://www.hexcolortool.com/#479a90). Wow, this resulted in some ugly colors, and really difficult to see not only due to color, but also due to the relative values/heights of the datasets. Additionally, simply lightening the colors does not guarantee that the darker and lighter versions will feel intuitively cohesive, in fact, Italy and the U.S.’s colors begin to look like a spectrum when they are broken down into a light and dark version each (this can be observed best in the legend)…which is definitely not something that makes sense with this data. Also, this would not work well for a colorblind viewer…overall, this is a much less effective plot than the original, in my opinion!\nThere we have it, a short exploration of color choice in at least one type of line plot.

Although yes, this does use more COVID data, it was a very nice exploration of how to go about using Shiny, and I must say, after working with it, I think it’s a tool that I will start using often to explore large datasets!\nThe Application:  This application uses Kieran Healy’s covdata package, a comprehensive collection of data relating to the Coronavirus pandemic. I decided to use the Apple U.S. Mobility dataset, specifically the vehicular-travel data, to create the application above. The app includes three identical widgets that can be used to select three different states in order to compare and contrast the data. The widgets’ upper plots show the daily case increase, and the bottom plot shows the daily mobility index, that is how the day’s mobility data differs from the baseline taken in January. The yellow indicates a lower level of travel for that particular day, and the green indicates more travel. Please explore the application and see what interesting observations you can make!\n The Code: Below is the code used to generate the Shiny app\nThe first section is simply the data wrangling process, processing the raw data in the covdata package in order to get it in the correct format for use in the plots. This is not an inherant piece of creating a Shiny application, but it useful to demonstrate the process of reshaping and winnowing down the dataset for this particular use!\nlibrary(shiny) library(gt) library(covdata) library(ggpubr) library(tidyverse) case_data \u0026lt;- nytcovstate locations \u0026lt;- sort(unique(case_data$state)) mobility_data \u0026lt;- apple_mobility %\u0026gt;% filter(region %in% locations) %\u0026gt;% select(-alternative_name, -geo_type) %\u0026gt;% mutate(state = region, region = NULL) data \u0026lt;- full_join(mobility_data, case_data) %\u0026gt;% mutate(fips = replace_na(fips, 0), cases = replace_na(cases, 0), deaths = replace_na(deaths, 0)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(state) %\u0026gt;% arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% mutate(daily_cases = (cases - (lag(cases)))) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(daily_cases = replace_na(daily_cases, 0)) transpo \u0026lt;- c(unique(data$transportation_type)) vec_brks \u0026lt;- c(-50, 0, 50) vec_labs \u0026lt;- vec_brks + 100 start_date \u0026lt;- sort(data$date)[1] end_date \u0026lt;- sort(desc(data$date))[1] Creating a Shiny application requires two main components, the ui componant, which is where the application creator can both tweak the layout of the application, as well as create interactive elements where the user can select from a number of options. For example, dateRangeInput() creates a widget where the user can enter a range of dates. The creator can select what the possible range can be, eliminate possibility for invalid date selections. There are many different input functions, and the elements can be arranged in many configurations in order to get the app looking just right!

It’s tricky to make predictions, but I’d think that a destination like Hawaii or Florida might be more popular in the cooler months, whereas more exotic, internations locations like London or Japan might be more popular in the warmer months, corresponding to the summertime where many tend to take longer trips.

First, we can see that, at least judging by the count for the top destination, the airport is busier during the warmer months, with November through February having markedly fewer flights than the other part of the year. We can see that Denver is a popular/common destination year-round (I think PDX-DEN is a big Frontier route, often on my way to visit family Illinois I end up with a layover there). But, during the cooler months, the destinations sway a bit warmer; Los Angeles and Phoenix.\nI chose to use gt since I really like the clean look and simplicity of the tables it generates, especially for a straightforward dataset like this one. I didn’t end up changing the defaults much, since I liked the column/row separations already. I did center the destination column, as it was left-aligned by default, and butted up against the months a bit too much. The destination and flight number columns make clean lines, and it is easy to read them up-and-down, and that really is the most important comparison here; how each column relates to the next sequentially/temporily, not necessarily how the destination relates to its’ associated number of flights.\n Analysis #2: Finding Busy Aircraft I am a nervous flyer, and definitely notice the wear and tear on a plane before I get on it…the longer it’s been in the air, the more reliable it has shown itself to be? So I tell myself…hah! But, I thought this was an interesting line of investigation. I’m going to make a table that displays the top five aircraft with the most flight time accumulated, and also include the associated airline, and the top two routes each aircraft flies.\npdx_flights_aircraft \u0026lt;- flights %\u0026gt;% filter(origin == \u0026quot;PDX\u0026quot;, tailnum!=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% select(tailnum, dest, air_time, carrier) %\u0026gt;% group_by(tailnum, carrier, dest) %\u0026gt;% summarize(airtime = sum(air_time)) %\u0026gt;% add_count(name = \u0026quot;total_airtime\u0026quot;, wt=airtime) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(total_airtime), desc(airtime)) first_set = seq(1, 15, by=3) second_set = seq(2, 15, by=3) third_set = seq(3, 15, by=3) pdx_flights_aircraft_filtered \u0026lt;- pdx_flights_aircraft %\u0026gt;% filter(total_airtime %in% unique(pdx_flights_aircraft$total_airtime)[1:5]) %\u0026gt;% group_by(tailnum) %\u0026gt;% top_n(3, wt = airtime) %\u0026gt;% select(-airtime) %\u0026gt;% mutate(dest_rank = case_when(row_number() %in% first_set ~ \u0026quot;dest_1\u0026quot;, row_number() %in% second_set ~ \u0026quot;dest_2\u0026quot;, row_number() %in% third_set ~ \u0026quot;dest_3\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = dest_rank, values_from = dest) %\u0026gt;% mutate(carrier = ifelse(carrier == \u0026#39;OO\u0026#39;, \u0026quot;SkyWest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() pdx_flights_aircraft_filtered %\u0026gt;% gt() %\u0026gt;% # tab_options(row.striping.background_color = \u0026quot;#f9f9f9\u0026quot;, # row.striping.include_table_body = TRUE, # row.striping.include_stub = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% tab_header(title=\u0026quot;Busiest Aircraft, by Total Airtime\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% tab_spanner(label = \u0026quot;Aircraft Details\u0026quot;, columns = vars(tailnum, carrier, total_airtime)) %\u0026gt;% tab_spanner(label = \u0026quot;Busiest Routes\u0026quot;, columns = vars(dest_1, dest_2, dest_3)) %\u0026gt;% cols_label(tailnum = \u0026quot;Tail\\nNumber\u0026quot;, carrier = \u0026quot;Carrier\u0026quot;, total_airtime = \u0026quot;Total Airtime \\n (min)\u0026quot;, dest_1 = \u0026quot;First\u0026quot;, dest_2 = \u0026quot;Second\u0026quot;, dest_3 = \u0026quot;Third\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% cols_align(align = \u0026quot;center\u0026quot;, columns = vars(total_airtime, dest_1, dest_2)) html { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

I first played a bit with kable in an attempt to do something different, but it just didn’t make a very attractive table, so I switched back to gt. Since there are a number of different types of information included in this table, I decided to make use of the tab_spanner option to call attention to that fact and do a bit of grouping. Then, I added striping, since in this case, the important grouping is by row, not necessarily comparing each row to each other, so I decided to encourage horizontal scanning of the table using this method.\n Analysis #3 Time of Day I’m curious to see whether certain destinations commonly correspond to morning, afternoon/evening, or red-eye flights, and also the relative representation of each type of flight. I’ll consider flights that leave between 5-11am morning flights, 11-8pm afternoon/evening flights, and the remainder red-eye flights (although these distinctions may not be perfect). I think this table is going to end up looking rather similar to the one above…we will see.\nfirst_set = seq(1, 15, by=5) second_set = seq(2, 15, by=5) third_set = seq(3, 15, by=5) fourth_set = seq(4, 15, by=5) fifth_set = seq(5, 15, by=5) pdx_flights_timeofday \u0026lt;- flights %\u0026gt;% filter(origin == \u0026quot;PDX\u0026quot;, !is.na(dep_time))%\u0026gt;% select(dest, dep_time) %\u0026gt;% mutate(time_of_day = case_when(dep_time \u0026gt;= 500 \u0026amp;

Fortunately, I didn’t have to change much from the default gt settings, just tinker with a titles to get the columns arranged in a more harmonious way. I really wanted to find a way to visually separate each timeframe’s data, but had trouble finding how to add vertical bars to separate the groups…although that may have ended up a bit chaotic anyway. Spanning labels will have to do! I do feel like adding the row for the total flights helped a bit, as we can distinctively see three values, indicating three groups. I think this is a pretty cool analysis of the dataset, particularly because it shows rather in-depth information about the distribution of top flights for each time of day, but also the total flights. Redeyes are definitely less popular/frequent, unsurprisingly!\nAs we can see, there are many interesting aspects of the flights dataset that can be explored using nothing more than the humble table.

The population is broken up by a two-level factor variable, with one on each side of the visualization, and then the data is binned based on a continuous variable. Although population pyramids typically use a factor variable of sex (male and female), and a continuous variable of age, and are often used to convey such information as a country’s fertility rate, the visualization can be generalized to other situations, in which it may be referred to as simply a “dual-sided histogram”. The type of visualization is a handy way to enhance a typical histogram by splitting it into two factor variables in order to facilitate comparison across groups within a population, while still being able to make observations about the population as a whole.\nHow to Read a Population Pyramid Visualization There are several useful takeaways that can be gleaned quickly and easily using a population pyramid:\n  How the overall distribution changes on the basis of age: To get a sense of the age distribution for the overall population, one can simply examine the shape of the plot/pyramid, focusing on how width changes from top to bottom. The wider the plot at any particular height, the more individuals in the age group corresponding to that position on the y-axis contribute to the overall population. So, if the “base”/bottom is wide compared to the rest of the plot, giving it a “pyramid”-like shape, the population is comprised of mostly younger individuals. However, if the overall “pyramid” is more rectangular, the age distribution is balanced. An upside-down pyramid would indicate a generally older population, and a “bulge” could indicate something like a baby boom around that particular age bracket’s birth years.\n  How the overall distribution differs based on sex: This is a fairly simple piece of information to glean from this type of plot – if the pyramid is heavier on one side than the other, then the population is skewed more heavily toward one particular sex than the other.\n  How the sex distribution changes as a function of age: We also can take into account both of the variables above and determine whether the sex distribution differs based on the age of that segment of the population. It’s difficult to think of an example that is not tragic, but, say, a plot of the demographics of the U.S. shortly after World War II may have more females than males in the age bracket 18-25 years old, but would likely be balanced in age brackets younger and older. In this case, the pyramid would be vertically asymmetric, with a “notch” on the male side at that age bracket. Examining the plot for these notches is a quick, simple way to determine whether the sex distribution differs for a particular age group.\n  Finally, in traditional population pyramids which depict age/sex distribution in a particular region, there are three shapes so commonly seen that they are given specific labels: expanding, contracting, and stationary, as shown below (graphic, as well as paraphrased information on each shape from a paper by Daniel Staetsky, full citation can be found in final section):\nA very triangular shape, with many more young representatives than older, as in the expanding pyramid, is indicative of a population that is growing, along with high fertility/mortality rates. The contracting shape, where the pyramid is pinched at the base is indicative of low fertility/mortality rates, corresponding to a population with few young people, relative to the rest of the group. Finally, the stationary pyramid, which has a columnal shape, tends to correspond to stable populations, with balanced, low fertility and mortality rates.\nDisclosure: Given the wide spectrum of gender identities present in modern society, I can absolutely understand how some may object to the binary nature of the population pyramid. Although I, and most who employ this type of visualization, specify the binary factor as biological “sex”, not gender, issues still remain. After a quick search, it doesn’t look like many have addressed this issue currently, but I would not be surprised to see multi-way analyses in the future (population stars??)!\nData The data used to generate the examples at the top of this page comes from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System dataset, which can be found at the following link: https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data . This dataset is quite rich, containing data gathered from a large number of emergency departments in the US. The overall dataset contains demographic information, including sex, age, and ethnicity, as well as a number of other interesting pieces of information including whether a particular product was involved in the injury (as in the left plot above, which includes all ER visits in the dataset from 2019 which involved a trampoline), and whether drugs or alcohol were involved in the injury. The dataset also includes for each datapoint/injury, a brief narrative outlining the loose details of the incident. The website contains a neat query system where the user can narrow down the dataset by filtering for year, product involved, and other data characteristics.\nFigure-Specific Details I opted to use a population pyramid for a slighly atypical analysis in the , that is, to examine the demographics of patients who visited a number of U.S. emergency rooms in 2019, using the dataset described above. I chose to narrow the dataset to two types of emergency room incidents, to depict two very different-looking population pyramids: the left plot shows the distribution of patients who visited the ER due to trampoline-related accidents, and the right plot shows the same of patients who visited the ER due to incidents involving the use of alcohol.\nI’ll use the general framework for interpreting a population pyramid described above to discuss the information I gleaned from these plots, first analyzing the plot on the left, then the plot on the right.\nTrampoline-Based Injuries As stated, this plot shows a breakdown of the age and sex characteristics of the group of individuals who visited the emergency room due to trampoline accidents in 2019. Prior to generating the plot, I hypothesized that the shape would be heavy at the base, and thinner on the top, as children are typical trampoline users, and I recall from my daredevil youth that I much preferred playing on a trampoline without a protective net. Though as an adult, I still struggle to ignore the siren song of the trampoline, I tend to be more careful than when I was a child. Stereotypes might lead some to believe that male children are more prone to taking trampoline-related risks, but I knew many a reckless young female when I was growing up, so I hypothesized a symmetric pyramid.\nIndeed, this is what the plot shows – a very heavy base, with a peak around 9-10 years old. Around the teenage years, these injuries drop off significantly, although not completely, perhaps in part due to some in the 25-40 year old age group having young children, and being tempted by their child’s trampoline. However, once we hit the mid-40’s, there are very few representatives from that cohort and older in this population. Additionally, the plot is quite symmetric – males and females are more-or-less equally represented in this population. There doesn’t appear to be an interaction of age and sex, as there are no bulges or notches present on one side but not the other.\nAccidents Involving Alcohol A slightly more sobering (sorry!) analysis is on the right – a population pyramid showing the age/sex distribution amongst ER visits resulting from alcohol-related injuries. In this case, I did hypothesize a difference between sexes, with males making up a somewhat larger proportion of the population, though still a fair few females. I also predicted a pear-shaped pyramid, with very few representatives from the 0-20 year old cohort, the bulk of patients in the 20-30 year old range, and a consistent taper down as age increased.\nI was somewhat surprised by the shape of the resulting plot. Although I’d anticipated a plot that was heavier on the male side than the female side, I hadn’t expected the difference to be so dramatic. Almost across the board, each male age cohort has about double (if not more) members than the corresponding female cohort. I was also surprised to see bimodal distributions on both sides, with a bulge from about the mid-teens through around 35, but then an even larger bulge in the older years, peaking around the early-to-mid sixties. Folks getting wild in their retirement years! Though females are represented less in the overall population distribution, these characteristics are still present in that sub-population’s distribution.\nI could see analyses like these being useful for target specific groups to recieve safety training on a particular product, deciding who to design flyers for, which, say, encourage moderation and safety when consuming alcohol, or to determine suggested age ranges for certain play equipment.\nPresentation Tips Color: Typically, this type of visualization uses color in a simple fashion, either using a uniform color and annotating each side with the appropriate label, or selecting two distinct colors to distinguish between one side and the other. Since a population pyramid generally plots the distribution of males versus females, we often see plots that select pink for the female distribution and blue for the male distribution. However, this is a bit of an anachronism in today’s society, as these colors carry the weight of long-term stereotypical gender associations. Some argue that choosing these colors allows for speedy interpretation of the figure, however, if a reader has so little time or mental energy that scanning a legend is unmanagable, then, well, perhaps they should skip looking at the figure altogether. Interestingly, it has been suggested that simply flipping the colors around can be problematic, as it can lead to confusion due to the aforementioned speedy interpretation of those particular colors in a figure.\nSo, I chose to create a graph with different colors altogether, inspired by the color choices in the Telegraph; green for males, and purple for females. A discussion of the motivation behind this choice, as well as more detailed arguments against the selection of blue/pink to distinguish male/female populations can be found at the following link: https://blog.datawrapper.de/gendercolor/ .\nAlthough some may consider it an attractive or interesting design detail to apply a color gratient based on age, this is not a common choice. Not only is it unnecessary to code this using color, since the axis makes the age range quite clear, it could also distract readers.\nFinally, avoid this color choice for this type of visualization at all costs! (But please do use this very attractive 70’s-inspired rainbow palette for your artistic projects!)\n Composition: Since these plots are fairly straight-forward, there are only a few small details to keep in mind regarding composition. The first is that even if the most populous bin in on one side is less than the most populous bin on the other, the x-axis should range from [-n, n], with n corresponding to the most populous bin overall. Although this is a small detail, this places the line dividing the sex/two-factor distributions directly in the middle of the plot, which can aid in accurate comparison of one sub-population versus the other. Also, in my opinion, it is much more visually harmonious.\nAnnotation:\nThe Population Pyramid is a useful visualization in no small part because of the rich possibilities of interpretation without the need for excessive labeling or annotation. However, if a particular feature of the shape of the plot corresponds to, say, a cultural event that is relevant to the context of the figure, it would be acceptable to add a small annotation to the plot, indicating the events related to the feature of the plot. As with all graph annotation, it is better to keep it minimal and clean. Below is an example of a well-annotated population pyramid (although perhaps with a bit much going on, I would personally keep it to one or two annotations):\n Although the annotations/labels add a fair bit of busyness to the figure, the story behind the plot is enriched with the additional details. Note that in addition to the annotations, the figure overlays the outline of a population pyramid from an earlier date on top of the more recent pyramid. This also allows additional temporal information to the figure’s story, which I find to be quite effective.\nIn contrast, here is a poorly annotated population pyramid:\n First of all…that font! But, that is not relevant to the discussion of the pyramid itself. In this case, although there is certainly information added through the annotations, the positioning and quantity of labels distracts from the overall impact of the figure. This quantity of information would be better suited to a narrative setting, alongside the figure, perhaps with numerical annotations indicating the feature of the plot that corresponds with the additional contextual information. However, the lines indicating the positions on the plat that correspond to each annotation are confusing, in that they point directly to one or the other side of the pyramid. This configuration could come across to the viewer as if only one of the sub-populations corresponds to the information in the annotation, e.g. the middle annotation on the right-hand side appears to be referring only to the female side of the pyramid, however, certainly females are not the only humans who will age!\nMethods Below is the code used to create one of the population pyramids, broken up into a chunk that shows the data wrangling process, and then one showing the plot generation, including the ggarrange() call that was used to combine the two plots.\nData Wrangling The data wrangling process was pretty straight-forward after downloading the data from the link provided in the data section, specifically downloading and working with the entire dataset from 2019. The .xlsx file consists of a row corresponding to each emergency room visit, and the columns to each piece of information related to that incident, so I simply had to narrow down the dataset to only include rows where the column alcohol_involved was equal to one. I also filtered out rows with age values higher than 100, as there were some instances where the age column contained a code that was not the actual age in years. I also filtered out rows where the patient’s sex was unknown.\nSince the dataset originally included column names with spaces, a configuration that does not play well with R code, I used the handy janitor::clean_names() function to convert the column names into R-friendly strings. Finally, I replaced the 1/2 indicators with “Male”/“Female”, primarily as a hacky way of making the plot’s legend more attractive, although this could have been done directly during the plotting phase. Finally, I narrowed the dataset down to just the sex and age columns, which is all that was needed for the population pyramids.\nalcohol_data \u0026lt;- read_excel(\u0026quot;neiss2019.xlsx\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% janitor::clean_names() %\u0026gt;% filter(alcohol_involved == 1, sex != 0, age \u0026lt; 100) %\u0026gt;% mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 1, \u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% select(sex, age)  Plotting The plots I created were adapted from code a couple of handy tutorials; the first two links in the citation section below.

The population is broken up by a two-level factor variable, with one on each side of the visualization, and then the data is binned based on a continuous variable. Although population pyramids typically use a factor variable of sex (male and female), and a continuous variable of age, and are often used to convey such information as a country’s fertility rate, the visualization can be generalized to other situations, in which it may be referred to as simply a “dual-sided histogram”. The type of visualization is a handy way to enhance a typical histogram by splitting it into two factor variables in order to facilitate comparison across groups within a population, while still being able to make observations about the population as a whole.\nHow to Read a Population Pyramid Visualization There are several useful takeaways that can be gleaned quickly and easily using a population pyramid:\n  How the overall distribution changes on the basis of age: To get a sense of the age distribution for the overall population, one can simply examine the shape of the plot/pyramid, focusing on how width changes from top to bottom. The wider the plot at any particular height, the more individuals in the age group corresponding to that position on the y-axis contribute to the overall population. So, if the “base”/bottom is wide compared to the rest of the plot, giving it a “pyramid”-like shape, the population is comprised of mostly younger individuals. However, if the overall “pyramid” is more rectangular, the age distribution is balanced. An upside-down pyramid would indicate a generally older population, and a “bulge” could indicate something like a baby boom around that particular age bracket’s birth years.\n  How the overall distribution differs based on sex: This is a fairly simple piece of information to glean from this type of plot – if the pyramid is heavier on one side than the other, then the population is skewed more heavily toward one particular sex than the other.\n  How the sex distribution changes as a function of age: We also can take into account both of the variables above and determine whether the sex distribution differs based on the age of that segment of the population. It’s difficult to think of an example that is not tragic, but, say, a plot of the demographics of the U.S. shortly after World War II may have more females than males in the age bracket 18-25 years old, but would likely be balanced in age brackets younger and older. In this case, the pyramid would be vertically asymmetric, with a “notch” on the male side at that age bracket. Examining the plot for these notches is a quick, simple way to determine whether the sex distribution differs for a particular age group.\n  Finally, in traditional population pyramids which depict age/sex distribution in a particular region, there are three shapes so commonly seen that they are given specific labels: expanding, contracting, and stationary, as shown below (graphic, as well as paraphrased information on each shape from a paper by Daniel Staetsky, full citation can be found in final section):\nA very triangular shape, with many more young representatives than older, as in the expanding pyramid, is indicative of a population that is growing, along with high fertility/mortality rates. The contracting shape, where the pyramid is pinched at the base is indicative of low fertility/mortality rates, corresponding to a population with few young people, relative to the rest of the group. Finally, the stationary pyramid, which has a columnal shape, tends to correspond to stable populations, with balanced, low fertility and mortality rates.\nDisclosure: Given the wide spectrum of gender identities present in modern society, I can absolutely understand how some may object to the binary nature of the population pyramid. Although I, and most who employ this type of visualization, specify the binary factor as biological “sex”, not gender, issues still remain.
