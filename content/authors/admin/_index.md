Hello! My name is Amie Roten, and I am currently a Master's student studying Computer Science at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. I originally hail from Central Illinois, and recieved my undergraduate degree in Linguistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to pursuing my degree in CS, I spent time working as a Research Assistant in a speech perception lab at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research at the Portland V.A., and became increasingly interested in how humans perceive sound, particularly speech, both in ideal circumstances and not-so-ideal. I've had the opportunity to extend this knowledge during my time at OHSU by applying it to automatic speech recognition problems, and am particularly fascinated by the overlap in human and machine 'hearing'.
